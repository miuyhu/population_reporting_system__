## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, comments)
- Team meetings and communications
- Project documentation and code
- Social media accounts representing the project
- Any other official project channels

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Issues**: Create a private issue or contact repository maintainers directly
2. **Email**: Contact project maintainers through their official email addresses
3. **Direct Communication**: Reach out to team leaders or module coordinators

All reports will be handled with confidentiality and discretion. We are committed to providing a safe reporting mechanism for all community members.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
