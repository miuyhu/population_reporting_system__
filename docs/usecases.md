# Use Case Specification – Population Reporting System

## UC01 – Generate Country Reports
**Description:**  
Allows users to generate reports of all countries, sorted by population or filtered by continent or region.

**Primary Actor:**  
System User / Analyst

**Preconditions:**  
- The database connection is active.
